			 <p>Recently Read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781668025475">Cahokia Jazz</a> by Francis Spufford. Loved this one. The setting is an alternative 1920s USA where the state of Cahokia is run by a native American/Catholic monarchy. Mix in murder, jazz, politics, and hard boiled detectives and it makes a world I&rsquo;d like to read more of. 📚</p>

<p>Yet, off the back of Manton’s recent posts regarding OpenAI, I read a number of responses from people on Mastodon that were needlessly antagonistic and emotionally detached, with some cancelling their subscriptions. Pile on!! These were posted to Mastodon but could be seen in an otherwise tranquil Micro.blog app thanks to the platform’s support for ActivityPub.Source: <a href="https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2024/143/a1/protocols/">Protocols, platforms and priorities · Paul Robert Lloyd</a></p>

<p>I like this response. It gets to why I&rsquo;m disenchanted with social media in general. I think it&rsquo;s obvious that <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> is a good person so some of the reactions to his comments were way over the top. Federated social media hasn&rsquo;t fixed the self-righteous blowhard problem but micro.blog is going a long way to make things better.</p>

			 <p>I became a full time laptop user this week after years of using iMacs as my main computer. My current iMac was the last of the 27 inch Intel machines and I&rsquo;ve been a bit underwhelmed by the current lineup. My useage has also changed in a lot of ways and so I decided to go for the best MacBook Pro I could afford. I went for the MacBook Pro M3 (Pro) with the default memory configuration and I&rsquo;m very pleased with it. There&rsquo;s a lot more power here than I probably need but this thing will be good for years to come.</p>

			 <p>I chose Qobuz as my music streaming service because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it prioritises albums over playlists</li>
<li>it has good editorial articles by humans</li>
<li>there are no aggressive algorithms feeding me more of the same</li>
<li>it just suggest new albums that usually push me out of usual routines</li>
<li>you can buy hires downloads from the qobuz store</li>
<li>it isn&rsquo;t a system to be gamed like Spotify</li>
<li>it sounds great</li>
<li>it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be run by a creep like Daniel Ek</li>
